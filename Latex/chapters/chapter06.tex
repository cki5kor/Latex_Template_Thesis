\chapter{Results and Analysis}
\label{ch:RA}
In this chapter we will discuss about the results obtained from designed architecture in this master thesis. The collection of samples, sensors used to collected the entropy and theoretical analysis of the final entropy rate estimation are done in accordance with the objectives as outlined in chapter \
